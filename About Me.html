<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    Im very passionate about learning how to code and the challenge it gives me,
    so i took it upon myself to figure out how to code my own games using Python. 
    I followed alot of guides via YouTube which certainly opened my eyes.
    Im now over on unity which is a games engine, you can create some amazing games on <a href="Unity.html" target="_blank">Unity</a>
    feel free to check out my python games within my  
    <a href="Guides.html" target="_blank"> Guides</a> section of my website.

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>
    Being on the coding course certainly helped me in the right direction, when it came to learning game design
    i took alot on board in regards to the basics and fundementals of coding. Biggest learning curve
    for me was understanding how things work and tick, once you open your mind to the elements of coding
    you will start to pick things up without even realising.
