<h1>Take The Next Step</h1>
<p>
    After watching and learning to build games using pygames, I wanted to take it up a notch, adding more elements and 
    taking more of a leap into the gaming creation world, after searching the web for a decent game engine, I stumbled 
    across Unity.
<br>
<br>
    The game engine itself is very user friendly, it's jammed-packed with alot of tutorials for newer users of the platform,
    it offers a lot of resources to make your game stand out, and be better than ever.
    I'd recommend watching a few guides on YouTube just to get you started and take your idea from there.

<h1>Bring Your Ideas To Life</h1>
<p>
What helped me design a game is physically drawing it out, you can use anything, from photoshop to a notepad, aslong as you have a reference. 
Just make sure you have an idea and layout in mind, before jumping in to create your game. 
<br>
<br>
Unity does have some preloaded templates which you can mess about on and get
an understanding towards funcations and layouts. You can also play your game as your building. It's pretty neat!
<br>
<br>
So... How goods your imagination?
