<h2>Take The Next Step</h2>
<p>
After watching and learning to build games using pygames, i wanted to take it up a notch, adding more elements and 
taking more of a leap into the gaminng creation world, after searching the web for a decent game engine, i stumbled 
across Unity.
<br>
<br>
The game engine itself is very user friendly, it's jam packed with alot of tutorials for newer users to the platform,
it offers alot of resources to make your game stand out thats for sure.
I'd recommend watching a few guides on YouTube just to get you started and take your idea from there.

<h2>Bring Your Ideas To Life</h2>
<p>
What helps  me design a game is physically drawing out the game, you can use anything, a notepad if you must. Just make sure you have an idea and layout in mind. 
<br>
<br>
Unity does have some preloaded templates which you can mess about on and get
an understanding towards funcations and layouts. You can also PLAY your game as your building. It's pretty neat!
<br>
<br>
So... How goods your imagination?
