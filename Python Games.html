    <h2>Hero</h2>
    <p>
        Hero was the first game i created using python, it's a platformer game with the objective to rearch the exit to get onto the level after,
        you need to be careful not to hit any of the enermies or lava along your way.
        When i started designing hero the guide i followed led me down one amazing path, looking at how far i've come along 
        the adventure, certainly inspired me to take it to the next level after doing some reseach i bumped into Unity which is where
        my taste for game design went futher.

    <h2>Neat Run</h2>
    <p>
        Neat Run is a jumping game, the objective of this game is to not hit any of the enemies coming towards you, the longer you stay alive the more 
        intense the game gets, this includes speed of the enemies and the rate they come at you.
        I designed this game for a friend of mine who wanted something to mess about on, he gave me the idea of the jumper games, so i went and researched
        then finding a guide on how to create one and following along.
